Comment=Leggi prima il commento dell'azione «Scrivi "Hello"».\n\nQt Designer usa Ctrl+F4 per chiudere le finestre, ma Ctrl+F4 in KDE significa «vai al desktop 4», quindi non funziona in Qt Designer, inoltre Qt Designer non usa la scorciatoia standard di KDE, Ctrl+W, per chiudere la finestra.\n\nIl problema si può risolvere riassegnando Ctrl+W su Ctrl+F4 quando la finestra attiva è Qt Designer. Quando Qt Designer è attivo, ogni volta che viene premuto Ctrl+W, verrà inviato Ctrl+F4 a Qt Designer. Nelle altre applicazioni Ctrl+W continua a funzionare come al solito\n\nDobbiamo specificare tre cose: una nuova scorciatoia su Ctrl+W, una nuova azione di immissione da tastiera che invia Ctrl+F4, infine una nuova condizione che la finestra attiva sia Qt Designer.\nQt Designer apparentemente ha sempre il titolo «Qt Designer by Trolltech», quindi la condizione controllerà che la finestra attiva abbia tale titolo.

Comment=Konqueror in KDE 3.1 ha le schede, e ora puoi avere anche i gesti.\n\nPremi semplicemente il tasto centrale del mouse e inizia a disegnare uno dei gesti; quando hai finito rilascia il tasto del mouse. Se devi solo incollare la selezione puoi ancora farlo, basta un clic col tasto centrale del mouse (Dalle impostazioni globali puoi scegliere il tasto da usare).\n\nAl momento sono disponibili i seguenti gesti: posta a destra e di nuovo a sinistra - Avanti (Alt+Destra) posta a sinistra e di nuovo a destra - Indietro (Alt+Sinistra)\nsposta in su e di nuovo in giù - Su (Alt+Su)\nfai un cerchio in senso antiorario - Ricarica (F5)\n\nLe forme dei gesti possono essere inserite semplicemente eseguendole nella finestra di configurazione. Per aiutarti puoi anche usare il tastierino numerico, i gesti vengono riconosciuti come una griglia di campi 3×3 numerati da 1 a 9.\n\nNota che devi eseguire il gesto esattamente per far scattare l'azione. Per questo motivo è possibile inserire più gesti per una singola azione. Dovresti evitare gesti complicati, in cui cambi la direzione di movimento del mouse più di una volta (cioè fai ad es. 45654 o 74123), perché sono abbastanza semplici da effettuare, ma, ad es. 1236987 è già piuttosto difficile).\n\nLa condizione per tutti i gesti sono definite in questo gruppo. Tutti questi gesti sono attivi solo se la finestra attiva è Konqueror (la classe contiene «konqueror»).
